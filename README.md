## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
To address the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers in India—particularly low digital literacy, language barriers, and limited access to real-time, scientific crop advisory—we propose a Community-Based Smart Crop Advisory System (CSCAS). This solution blends offline-first technology, edge AI, IoT sensors, and community participation to deliver localized, real-time, and accessible agricultural support.

Core Features:

Agri-Kiosks with Offline Capabilities
Installed at Gram Panchayats, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), or local farmer centers, these solar-powered kiosks run advisory software in regional languages. Farmers can access personalized guidance even without smartphones or internet.

Agri-Sevaks (Local Youth Facilitators)
Trained local youths act as digital intermediaries, helping farmers interact with the system, understand recommendations, and collect data (e.g., crop photos, soil test reports).

Low-Cost IoT Soil and Weather Sensors
Community fields are equipped with basic sensors to track soil moisture, pH, temperature, and environmental conditions. This data feeds into the advisory engine for location-specific insights.

AI-based Pest and Disease Detection
Farmers can bring crop samples or photos to the kiosk. Edge AI models (running on local devices) process the images offline to identify diseases and suggest treatments using government-approved methods.

IVRS and Voice-based Support
A toll-free Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) provides farmers with voice-based advice, weather alerts, and mandi price updates in their language, without the need for internet or smartphones.

Farmer Data & Feedback System
Each farmer has a digital profile (linked by Aadhaar or mobile number). Feedback is collected regularly to improve the system. The platform supports updates via mobile app, SMS, or voice call.

Integration with Extension Services
The platform connects with government extension officers, allowing them to track issues (e.g., pest outbreaks) and provide targeted training or support.

## Feasibility and Viability
**Technical Feasibility**

Offline-first model ensures core features run without real-time internet.

Low-cost, scalable hardware (RPi, sensors) makes deployment affordable.

AI and NLP advancements allow localized, intelligent decision-making.

Existing tools like Bhashini, IMD APIs, and AgMarkNet can be integrated easily.

** Operational Feasibility**

Village kiosks can be managed by trained local Agri-Sevaks.

Support from KVKs, agricultural universities, and NGOs enables smooth rollout.

IVRS ensures reach even among non-smartphone and illiterate users.

 **Financial Viability**

Initial funding through CSR programs, government schemes (e.g., PM-KISAN, Digital India).

**Long-term sustainability via:**

Freemium model: Free basic advisory, paid advanced insights.

Partnerships with input providers (fertilizers, seeds).

Premium services: AI-based forecasting, insurance suggestions, etc.

** Scalability**

Modular system design allows gradual rollout across:

Districts → States → National Level.

Can be adapted to local crop calendars, dialects, and agro-climatic zones

## Impact and Benefits
**For Farmers**

Increased Yield & Reduced Input Costs: Scientific recommendations tailored to crop, soil, and weather conditions.

Inclusive Access: Even non-literate farmers benefit via IVR and voice support.

Reduced Crop Loss: Timely pest detection and weather alerts.

Market Empowerment: Awareness of mandi prices enables better price negotiation.

Reduced Chemical Misuse: Precise fertilizer and pesticide guidance.

** For Government & Extension Workers**

Data-Driven Decisions: Real-time dashboards highlight village-level issues.

Efficient Resource Allocation: Extension officers can focus efforts where needed.

Policy Design: Usage data can guide future agri policies and subsidies.

 **For Society & Environment**

Sustainable Agriculture: Encourages less water and chemical use.

Food Security: Higher productivity supports national food supply.

Empowerment: Local youth (Agri-Sevaks) gain employment and digital skills.
